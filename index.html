            <h2>Feedback and Quality Assurance</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <p>Collecting feedback from students and faculty allows educational institutions to continuously improve the quality of education and administrative services. This business case promotes SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by ensuring that resources are used efficiently and that educational outcomes are constantly enhanced through feedback-driven quality improvement processes.</p>
                <p><strong>Target 12.6:</strong> Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This system fosters continuous improvement, making educational services more sustainable and adaptable to changing needs.</p>
